## Detailed Command Documentation

### `forge init`
Initializes `.forge/config.yaml` and standard `docs/system/` scaffolding.
```bash
forge init [--repo <path>] [--dry-run]
```
* `--repo`: Target directory (defaults to current directory).
* `--dry-run`: Print actions without creating files.

### `forge doctor`
Checks Python runtime, Git binary, Tree-sitter parsers, and terminal console compatibility.
```bash
forge doctor
```

### `forge check`
Verifies claim freshness, AST anchor resolution, derived tier freshness, and gate integrity.
```bash
forge check [--repo <path>] [--scope <scope>]
```
**Exit Codes:**
* `0`: All claims fresh, 0 errors.
* `1`: Stale claims, broken anchors, or gate violations detected.

### `forge sync derived`
Recomputes AST dependencies, test mappings, and inventory from Git HEAD.
```bash
forge sync derived [--repo <path>]
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always commit your source code changes *first*, then run `forge sync derived` and commit the updated `docs/system/derived/` files.

### `forge claim`
Scaffolds, inspects, and stamps claims in the system store:
```bash
# Print a claim template for a given kind
forge claim new invariant --id INV-refund-cap --title "Refund never exceeds capture"

# View one claim as written
forge claim show INV-refund-cap

# Stamp unstamped anchors of a claim at HEAD (or specified commit)
forge claim stamp INV-refund-cap
forge claim stamp --all
```

### `forge change`
Manages changes in `changes/XXXX-name/`:
```bash
# Create a new change workspace
forge change new "add-jwt-validation"

# List active changes
forge change list

# Show change status and open gates
forge change show 0001

# Archive a completed change (a top-level command, not a `change` subcommand)
forge archive --change 0001
```

### `forge gate <checkpoint>`
Evaluates whether a change satisfies prerequisites to advance to the next development phase:
```bash
forge gate spec:post --change 0001
forge gate impact:post --change 0001
forge gate analyze:post --change 0001
forge gate implement:pre --change 0001
```

The points are fixed by the kernel: `investigate:pre`, `spec:post`, `impact:post`, `analyze:post`, `implement:pre`,
`implement:task:post`, `verify:post`, `sync:pre`, `converge:post` (`forge gate --help` prints the current list).
There is no gate after `proposal` or `design`: those artifacts are checked by the DAG, not by a gate.

### `forge verify`
Runs test commands configured in `.forge/config.yaml` and reconciles touched claims against git diff:
```bash
forge verify --change 0001
```

### `forge reconcile`
Inspects all drift events in `docs/system/DRIFT.md` and attributes blame/resolution:
```bash
forge reconcile [--repo <path>]
```

### `forge report`
Opens a pre-filled, sanitized issue template in your browser to report a bug or request a feature:
```bash
forge report [--feature] [--no-browser]
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Telemetry Policy

Forge is committed to **Zero Secret Telemetry**:
* 100% of core calculations run offline and locally.
* When reporting issues via `forge report` or during an unexpected crash, all local usernames and paths are scrubbed (`/home/<user>` or `C:\Users\<user>` becomes `~`).
* Nothing is ever submitted silently; you always review and submit issues yourself. For full details, see [PRIVACY.md](https://github.com/CodeGenLabs/forge-harness/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).
