# Core Concepts

Forge provides deterministic governance over software development through five foundational concepts.

---

## 1. The 3-Tier Architecture

Forge strictly partitions repository knowledge into three distinct tiers:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph T1 ["Tier 1: Human Intent"]
        D1["docs/system/domain.md"]
        D2["docs/system/pitfalls.md"]
        D3["docs/system/decisions/*.md"]
    end
    
    subgraph T2 ["Tier 2: Agent Work"]
        C1["changes/XXXX-name/proposal.md"]
        C2["changes/XXXX-name/design.md"]
        C3["changes/XXXX-name/impact.md"]
        C4["changes/XXXX-name/tasks.md"]
    end

    subgraph T3 ["Tier 3: Machine Truth"]
        M1["docs/system/derived/inventory.json"]
        M2["docs/system/derived/deps.json"]
        M3["docs/system/derived/tests.json"]
        M4["docs/system/derived/trace.json"]
    end

    T1 -->|Guides| T2
    T2 -->|Modifies Code| Code[(Repository Source Code)]
    T3 -.->|Deterministic Scan| Code
    T3 -.->|Validates Integrity| T2
```

1. **Human Intent (Tier 1)**: Authored rules and design constraints. Machine cannot overwrite these without human review.
2. **Agent Work (Tier 2)**: Structured change workspaces where agents and developers propose, refine, and verify atomic features.
3. **Machine Truth (Tier 3)**: Auto-generated from git commits. Never authored by hand; regenerated via `forge sync derived`.

---

## 2. Claims & The Claim Store

A **Claim** is a formal, unambiguous statement about the codebase with explicit anchors:

```markdown
### PIT-token-never-logged
Tokens must never appear in unredacted application logs.
<!-- forge:claim
status: ratified
anchors:
  - src/auth/token.py#create_session_token
  - src/logging/formatter.py#RedactingFormatter
-->
```

### Claim Statuses
* `candidate`: Proposed finding under review.
* `ratified`: Actively enforced contract. Breaking this fails CI.
* `retired`: No longer applicable (e.g., deprecated subsystem).

---

## 3. AST Anchors & Fingerprints

Unlike traditional documentation that cites line numbers (which break on the very next commit), Forge binds claims directly to AST nodes:
* `src/core/router.py#Router.dispatch`
* `packages/ui/src/button.tsx#PrimaryButton`
* `internal/storage/sqlite.go#OpenDatabase`

### Fingerprint Resilience
When `src/core/router.py` is modified:
1. Whitespace changes? **Anchor stays fresh.**
2. Comments or docstrings updated? **Anchor stays fresh.**
3. Symbol body modified or renamed? **Anchor is flagged as stale.**
4. Symbol deleted? **Anchor is flagged as missing.**

## 4. Change Lifecycle & Gates

Every meaningful change follows a 4-stage lifecycle:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as "Developer / Agent"
    participant Forge as "Forge Gatekeeper"
    participant Git as "Git HEAD"

    Dev->>Forge: forge change new "jwt-auth"
    Note over Dev,Forge: Stage 1: Proposal (Why)
    Dev->>Forge: forge gate spec:post
    Note over Dev,Forge: Stage 2: Design & Impact (What)
    Dev->>Forge: forge gate impact:post
    Dev->>Forge: forge gate analyze:post
    Note over Dev,Forge: Stage 3: Implementation & Tasks
    Dev->>Git: Edit Code & Tests
    Note over Dev,Forge: Stage 4: Verification & Archive
    Dev->>Forge: forge verify --change 0001
    Forge-->>Dev: PASS (Tests green, claims accounted for)
    Dev->>Forge: forge archive --change 0001
```

---

## 5. Attributed Drift

When code changes outpace documentation, `forge check` pinpoints:
* Exact commit SHA that caused the divergence
* Author who committed it
* Anchored symbol that changed
* Impacted claim ID
