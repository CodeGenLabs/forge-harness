"""The drift ledger: what the kernel computes, and what it refuses.

The division this file is about: the kernel can tell that code moved, and it
cannot tell what that means. So every test here is either about a detection
being recorded faithfully, or about a resolution being refused for a reason
that is checkable - a V3 naming an ADR that does not exist, a V2 with no
evidence. The kernel never picks a verdict and never edits a claim's prose.
