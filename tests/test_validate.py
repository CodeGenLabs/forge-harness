"""S1-S18, the claim-store checks.

The M0 acceptance criterion has two halves and both are here: a hand-written
store of ten claims across the five MVP kinds passes `forge check` clean, and
every check has a fixture that fails it with the right code.

The clean store is the load-bearing half. A validator nobody can satisfy is a
validator that gets bypassed, and eighteen checks written without one is
exactly how that happens - each is defensible alone, and together they forbid
every real claim anyone would write.

governs: [CMP-payments]

Handlers may call the domain; the domain must never call back. Inverting this
is what turns a refund rule into something you can only test by standing up a
web server, and it is the single change that makes the domain untestable.

### ARC-no-cycles — Module dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph

```claim

anchors: [src/pay.py]
governs: [CMP-ledger]
since: ADR-0001

A cycle between modules must be broken at the point it is introduced. Left in,
it removes the possibility of loading either half alone, which is what every
later attempt to extract a service runs into.

Owns every decision about how much money may move and when. It must reject an
overdraw at its boundary rather than clamping, because a clamp silently
under-refunds a customer and leaves no trace that it happened.

# Domain

### CON-capture — Taking money that was previously authorised

```claim
kind: concept
status: asserted
truth-source: decision
anchors: []
reviewed: 2026-09-01
```

A capture is distinct from an authorisation: the authorisation reserves, the
capture takes. Treating them as one word is what produces code that refunds
against a reservation that never moved any money.

### CON-settlement — Money that has left the acquirer and cannot be recalled

```claim
kind: concept
status: asserted
truth-source: decision
anchors: []
reviewed: 2026-09-01
```

Settlement is the point of no return, and it is not the same as a successful
response. A payment may succeed and never settle, so no rule may treat the two
as interchangeable.

### INV-refund-cap — A refund never exceeds the captured amount

```claim
kind: invariant
status: enforced
truth-source: tests
anchors: [src/pay.py#refundable]
evidence:
  - test: tests/test_pay.py::test_refund_never_exceeds_capture
reviewed: 2026-09-01
```

Partial refunds accumulate: what is bounded is the sum of settled refunds, not
each refund on its own. An attempt over the remaining balance must be rejected
at the domain boundary rather than clamped.

### INV-idempotent-capture — Capturing twice with one key moves money once

```claim
kind: invariant
status: enforced
truth-source: tests
anchors: [src/pay.py#capture]
evidence:
  - test: tests/test_pay.py::test_capture_is_idempotent
reviewed: 2026-09-01
```

A retry must be indistinguishable from the first attempt. Networks retry
without asking, so any rule that assumes one delivery per request is a rule
that will double-charge somebody.
"""

# Pitfalls

### PIT-float-money — Money is never a floating-point number here

```claim
kind: pitfall
status: asserted
truth-source: decision
anchors: [src/pay.py]
reviewed: 2026-09-01
```

Every amount is an integer count of minor units. This was paid for: a rounding
difference of a fraction of a unit accumulated across a settlement batch and
had to be reconciled by hand.

### PIT-retry-storm — A failed capture must not be retried in a tight loop

```claim
kind: pitfall
status: asserted
truth-source: decision
anchors: [src/pay.py]

request handler.
