## Purpose

How money is captured from an authorisation and returned to a payer, and what

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-refunds-1 - An operator can refund a settled payment
The system SHALL allow a refund against any settled payment up to its remaining
refundable balance.

#### Scenario: Partial refund within balance
- **WHEN** an operator refunds 30 against a payment of 100 with no prior refunds
- **THEN** the refund settles and the remaining refundable balance is 70
