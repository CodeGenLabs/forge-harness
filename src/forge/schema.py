"""Workflow schemas: the artifact DAG, loaded as data and validated like code.

A workflow is a YAML file declaring which artifacts a change produces, what
each one requires, and which tracks require it. Adding a workflow is adding a
file (ARCHITECTURE.md section 4.3) - that is the property that keeps the kernel
small as the harness grows, and it only holds if nothing about a workflow is
expressed in Python.

The kernel ships `feature` as text, not as a dict, and `forge init` writes that
same text to `.forge/schema/feature.yaml`. One code path loads both, so the
built-in default cannot drift from what a project gets when it edits its copy.

Two additions to OpenSpec's model, both from ARCHITECTURE.md section 4.1:

- **`tracks`** per artifact, the scale router expressed as data. One DAG serves
  every track; the track selects which nodes are required. The alternative is
  a workflow file per size, which is how GSD arrived at `quick`, `fast`,
  `sketch`, `spike` and `do` as five separate commands.
- **`reads`**, the explicit context contract, so a phase loads exactly what it
  is entitled to rather than whatever the prompt remembered to mention.
