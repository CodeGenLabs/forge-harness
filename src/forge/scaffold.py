"""Templates, and the scaffold `forge init` writes.

Two rules the templates follow, both learned from the corpus:

**A generated claim is deliberately invalid.** Every template carries
`{placeholder}` tokens, and S9 rejects those. So a claim created and not
written fails `forge check` with a line number and a fix - which is the
behaviour you want, because the alternative is a store that fills up with
headings nobody finished. The placeholders are the checklist.

**The scaffold contains no claims.** `forge init` writes empty, titled files
and one ADR recording the adoption. Generating plausible starter claims for a
codebase nobody has read is precisely the failure the candidates tier exists to
prevent (SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md section 2.4); that job belongs to `forge
bootstrap`, which routes its guesses through review.

# System overview

One screen. What this system is for, who uses it, and the two or three facts a
newcomer needs before any other document makes sense.

This file is loaded into every agent context, so it is under a hard line budget
together with the claim files beside it (S16). When it grows, something moves
out - the budget is never raised.
"""

_PRODUCT = """# Product intent

Written once, at the start, and edited rarely. `OVERVIEW.md` describes the
*system*; this describes the *intent*, and nothing else in the store carries
it. A request like "build something like <product>" that never becomes the
four sections below is how a project ships a thing that runs without being
the thing that was wanted.

## What this is for, and who for

One paragraph. The user, the job, and what they do today instead.

## Reference products

Which existing products this is measured against, and what each is being
referenced *for* - not admiration, a yardstick. If a manual or a running copy
is available, say where it is: a reference nobody opens is the same as none.

For each capability that references one of these, the spec owes a parity list:
what the reference does, and for every item either it is built or it is
deferred **with a reason**. Silence is the defect, because silence reads as
"considered and rejected" six months later when it was never considered.

## Non-goals

What this deliberately will not be. This section does more work than the first
one: a scope with no edge is not a scope, and every argument about whether
something belongs is settled here or nowhere.

## Deferred

Things that are wanted and are not being built yet, each with the condition
that would change that. This list is the honest form of "later" - it keeps a
decision visible instead of letting it decay into an omission.

# ADR-0001 - Adopt an anchored claim store

- Date: {date}
- Status: Accepted

## Context

Knowledge about this system was spread across prose documents that nothing
checked. Prose cannot be verified, so it drifts silently and is then either
trusted when it is wrong or ignored when it is right.

## Decision

System knowledge lives in anchored claims under `docs/system/`, each pointing
at the code it describes, each checked by `forge check`. Staleness is detected
deterministically against those anchors; no model decides whether a claim is
still true.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep free prose and review it periodically.** Rejected: review debt is
  invisible, so the review never happens on the documents that need it.
- **Let a model check the documentation against the code.** Rejected on
  measurement: models detect documentation faults well when the prose changed
  and badly when only the implementation did, which is the case that matters.

## Consequences

Every change must account for the claims its diff touches, which is new work at
the point of change and is the entire point. Nothing here is enforced until the
first claims exist - run `forge bootstrap`, or write them as you learn them.
