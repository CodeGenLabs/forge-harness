"""Safe, deterministic git access.

Two rules govern this module, and both come from the research:

1. **git is never invoked through a shell.** Every call is a list of argv
   elements passed to ``subprocess.run`` with ``shell=False``.
2. **No stored value reaches git unvalidated.** Anchors carry SHAs and paths
   that were read out of a markdown file, which is untrusted input as far as
   argv is concerned. GSD validates ``built_at_commit`` as 4-40 hex characters
   for exactly this reason ("a hostile graph.json cannot inject dashed options
   into argv"); we apply the same rule to every revision and every path.

Nothing here calls a model, and every function is a pure function of the
repository at a commit.
