"""`forge verify`: evidence that a change is done, as an artifact.

Not an opinion. `verification.json` is generated and never authored, because
an authored verification report is a place to write "all tests pass" without
having run them - which is the exact failure Superpowers wrote a whole skill
to prevent.

**Tests passing is item 1 of 8** (WORKFLOW.md section 3.9). That is the
concrete answer to "the harness must not declare success merely because tests
pass":

1. build, typecheck, lint, test - fresh output, captured here, not remembered
2. every `REQ-*` in this change discharged by a test carrying its `@covers` tag
3. every `enforced` claim in the touch set still proved by its evidence
4. `impact.md`'s claim-touch account complete
5. no open unwaived drift touching this change's claims
6. no open unwaived debt introduced by this change
7. `derived/` regenerates to a no-op
8. no test skipped that was passing before this change

Conditions 5, 6 and 8 need ledgers and a baseline test run that no milestone
has built. They are reported as `unavailable`, never as `pass`: a condition
that reports success because nothing checked it is the thing this file exists
to prevent.
