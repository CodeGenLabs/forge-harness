"""Normalised-AST fingerprints, and locating a named declaration.

The mechanism is adopted from Fiberplane's `drift` documentation linter: parse
the source with tree-sitter and hash a normalised fingerprint of the syntax
tree - node kinds plus token text, with whitespace, comments and positions
dropped. The point is a comparison that is insensitive to reformatting and to
comment edits but sensitive to anything that changes what the code does.

Two deliberate properties:

* **A missing grammar is not a failure.** Without a grammar the source is
  reduced to a whitespace-normalised content hash and the result carries
  ``coarse=True``. The harness works with zero grammars installed, just less
  precisely, and the weaker signal is visible rather than silent.
* **Signature and body are fingerprinted separately.** A change confined to a
  function body is a weaker signal than a change to its name, parameters or
  return type. That distinction is what lets the drift ledger stay quiet about
  ordinary edits (``shifted``) and speak up about contract changes (``stale``)
  - see OPEN_QUESTIONS.md Q2.

      anonymous leaves under a wrapper node, and dropping them would erase the

    * **Depth is encoded**, so the flat sequence reconstructs the tree. Without
      it, two different shapes could serialise identically.

    Iterative rather than recursive: TypeScript and Go trees nest deeply enough
