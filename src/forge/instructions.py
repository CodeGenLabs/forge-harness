"""`forge instructions`: resolving an artifact's `reads` contract.

ARCHITECTURE.md calls this the single most important structural difference
from every prompt-first framework in the corpus, and the claim is narrow
enough to be worth restating exactly: **what a phase is entitled to read is a
property of the data model, not of the prompt.** The DAG declares it, the
kernel resolves it, and a phase that wants more has to change the schema -
where the change is visible - rather than quietly widening a paragraph.

Three selector shapes, from ARCHITECTURE.md section 4.1:

- a path, with `${change}` substituted and globs expanded;
- `derived: [deps, inventory]`, naming artifacts of the derived tier;
- `claims: metadata` for the whole store's index, or
  `claims: "${impact.claims_touched}"` for the bodies of exactly the claims
  this change reaches.

The last one is the point. `design` reads the claims the change actually
touches - not all of them, not a summary, not whatever fit - and that set is
computed, so it cannot drift from what `impact.md` had to account for.
