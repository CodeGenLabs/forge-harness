"""The derived tier: facts regenerated from the repository, never authored.

The store's rule is "store judgements, derive facts" (CONSTITUTION.md IV). This
module is the deriving half. Everything it writes is reproducible from the
repository at a commit, carries the commit it was produced from, and is
committed so its diffs are visible in review.

**No timestamp.** SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md section 2.3 sketched the envelope with a
``generated_at`` field, which cannot coexist with the requirement two paragraphs
later that regeneration be a no-op and that ``forge check`` fail on a dirty
derived file: a timestamp makes every regeneration differ, so the dirty check
could never pass. The commit id is the provenance that matters - it is what the
staleness signal compares - and the wall clock adds nothing a git log does not
already have. The design document has been corrected to match.

Determinism is a hard requirement, not an aspiration: every mapping is written
with sorted keys, every list is sorted, and no value is derived from the
environment (no paths outside the repo, no locale, no clock).

    **Commits that touched only the derived tier do not count.** A file cannot
    contain the id of the commit that contains it, so committing a freshly
    derived artifact necessarily leaves it stamped with its parent. Counting
    that as staleness would make the steady state permanently one commit behind,
    and regenerating to fix it would produce another such commit - a treadmill.
    The honest reading is that a commit which only rewrites derived data does
    not make derived data stale, and the pathspec below says exactly that.
