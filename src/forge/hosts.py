"""A second host costs a manifest, not a port - stated as a table you can read.

OPEN_QUESTIONS.md Q12 chose one host for v1 "structured so a second is cheap",
against Superpowers' eight plugin manifests and ~15KB of sync script, and Spec
Kit's bash, PowerShell *and* Python copies of every script. The bet was that
keeping the mechanism in a CLI and the procedures in plain markdown makes the
second host a manifest.

This file is where that bet is either true or exposed. Adding a host is adding
an entry to `HOSTS`, and if a host ever needs more than an entry - a rewritten
skill, a host-specific branch in the kernel - the bet was wrong and the cost
should be paid visibly here rather than spread through the skills.

The audit that made this honest: six of the seven skills named no host feature,
and `bootstrap` told the reader to fan out across subagents - a mechanism where
it meant an outcome. `skill.host_specific` now checks that, because a rule that
holds because somebody looked once is not a rule.

**Nothing here writes a format this project has not seen.** Each entry says
where a host reads from and in what shape, and the two here are the two that
could be verified: a pointer file, and the layout `forge init` already writes.
