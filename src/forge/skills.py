"""Skills: procedures written as markdown, and the five rules they must obey.

A skill is the only part of the harness that a model reads and acts on. That
makes it the part most likely to rot, because prose has no compiler - which is
the failure this whole project is about. So the five rules from
ARCHITECTURE.md section 4.2 are checked here, mechanically, and `forge skill
check` is a gate like any other.

The rules, and why each is checkable rather than advisory:

1. **≤ 250 lines.** Above that the procedure is doing too much. Superpowers'
   two longest skills (568 and 679 lines) are its two least crisp, and length
   is the one property of a prompt that correlates with nothing good.
2. **Kernel-first.** Anything computable is a command, not a paragraph. A
   skill that re-derives `forge check` in prose is a second implementation
   that nothing tests, so `requires-kernel` must name real commands and each
   must actually appear in the body.
3. **No compulsion language.** No all-caps imperatives, no "you have no
   choice". If a step needs that, it needs a gate - and a gate is enforced
   where shouting is not.
4. **Announce on entry.** One line, so the transcript records which procedure
   ran. Without it there is no way to tell afterwards whether the skill fired.
5. **Pressure-tested.** Scenarios in `tests/skills/<name>/`, with the failure
   the skill prevents written down. The honest limit is recorded in
   `PRESSURE.md`: the deterministic half runs here, the model-in-the-loop half
   does not run in CI.
