"""The traceability index: ID conventions plus grep, no database.

SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md section 8 argues that bidirectional traceability needs a
naming convention and four scans, not a datastore. This is those four scans.

``trace.json`` is a **build artifact, never a source of truth**. It is
regenerated from the repository, so it cannot disagree with the repository,
there is no schema to migrate, and `git checkout` of an old commit yields that
commit's index. Everything it contains is recoverable with grep; the index
exists so the answer is one lookup instead of five.

What it can answer, and how:

===========================================  ==================================
Which requirement caused this code?           back-references, reversed
Which tests verify this ID?                   ``@covers`` tags, reversed
Which claims does this one govern?            the claim's own ``governs``
Which claims govern this one?                 ``governs``, reversed
Which ADR explains this claim?                the claim's ``since``, and the
                                              ADR's own references
Which changes touched this ID?                mentions under ``changes/``
Which IDs are referenced but do not exist?    every edge, resolved
===========================================  ==================================

What it deliberately cannot answer is which *line* of code implements a
requirement. Line-level traceability is achievable and decays, and decayed
traceability is worse than none because it reads as complete. The granularity
here is file-to-claim and test-to-requirement, and that trade is deliberate
(SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md section 8.3).
