"""The drift ledger: detected, classified as far as evidence allows, human-resolved.

SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md section 6. `docs/system/DRIFT.md` is machine-appended and
human-resolved, and the split is the whole point: the kernel says *what moved*,
which it can compute, and never *what that means*, which it cannot.

The rule this file exists to hold: **there is no command that rewrites a claim
to match the code.** Auto-reconciliation would make the store a lagging copy of
the implementation, which is exactly the thing the harness is supposed to
notice. So a resolution records a verdict and the human edits the claim, and the
kernel's contribution is to refuse the resolutions that are not honest - a V3
naming an ADR that does not exist, a V2 with no evidence note.

An entry looks like a claim on purpose. Same heading-plus-fence shape, parsed by
the same idiom, so there is one thing to learn and one grammar to get wrong.
